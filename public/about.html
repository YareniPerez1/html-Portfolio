  When I am not at college or doing homework for those classes I like to spend time with my S/O as well as my family and friends, I am a BIG family lover.
   They are my favorite people. If I am not occupied with anything I like to look for courses to strengthen my knowledge on different things that I am learning in the bachelor program. Right now I am doing a web development course and love it!
